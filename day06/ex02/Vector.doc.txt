<- Vector ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Vector class handles the representation of vector.
It need to include a class Vertex and class Color for correct work of the class.

A vector is represented by the following characteristics:
x, y, z and w. (x = 0, y = 0, z = 0, w = 1 by default).

An intance has one mandotory parameter - destination point:
new Vector( array('dest' => new Vertex( array('x' => 2, 'y' => 3, 'z' => 4))));
It is also can have another additional parameter such as origin point.
If that point will not be presented, it wil be created with defaul value -
x = 0, y = 0, z = 0, w = 1.

The class provides the following methods :

float	magnitude();
returns the vector’s length.

Vector	normalize();
Returns a normalized version of the vector. If the vector is
already normalized, returns a fresh copy of the vector.

Vector add( Vector $rhs );
Returns the sum vector of both vectors.

Vector sub( Vector $rhs );
Returns the difference vector of both vectors.

Vector opposite();
Returns the opposite vector.

Vector scalarProduct( $k );
Returns the multiplication of the vector with a scalar.

float dotProduct( Vector $rhs );
Returns the scalar multiplication of both vectors.

float cos( Vector $rhs );
Returns the angle’s appendix cosine between both vectors.

Vector crossProduct( Vector $rhs );
Returns the cross multiplication of both vectors.
